# Guess the Number

This project, **Guess the Number**, is a simple Python-based game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct, helping the player narrow down their guesses.

## What I Did
- Designed and implemented the game logic in Python.
- Created an interactive notebook (`game.ipynb`) to demonstrate the functionality.
- Used random number generation to ensure unpredictability in the game.
- Added input validation to handle incorrect or out-of-range guesses.
- Provided clear feedback to guide the player toward the correct answer.

## Code Overview
The game logic is structured as follows:
1. **Random Number Generation**: A number is randomly selected within a predefined range.
2. **Player Input**: The player is prompted to guess the number.
3. **Feedback System**: The program compares the guessed number to the target and provides feedback (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low").
4. **Loop Until Correct**: The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
5. **End Message**: Once the correct number is guessed, the game congratulates the player.

This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling, making it a great introduction to Python for beginners.
